# Mobileye-Project
Finding traffic lights in the picture and calculating their distance

# Phase 1:Traffic Lights Attention
Detected light source in an image using high pass filter and local maxima.

# Phase 2:Traffic Light Detection and Processes data,
creating data for the tarining. Built and trained CNN in order to determine a traffic light.

# Phase 3:Finding the traffic light distance
Measured the geometric distance of each traffic light with SFM and Epipolar Geometry.

# Phase 4:finish
Complete all parts of the project for a perfect project
